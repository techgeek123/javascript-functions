1. Write a function called displayFullName, which should accept two parameters, firstName and lastName. The function should be immediately invoked and return the firstName + lastName. You should NOT have to call this function, it should invoke right away.

2. Write a function called createCalculator, which should return an object that has four methods, add, subtract, multiply and divide.
